# Design Studio Feedback

Peer group members: Leila Hofer, Robert Krabek. 

In general our peer group likes our design. They commented that our visualization will be useful for those who want to buy flight tickets and compare which airline will be more on-time.

They also provided helpful suggestions as listed below, followed by how we will address it in the future revision:

1. Some airports are very busy and may have hundreds of connected destination airports. If we show every connected flight routes on the map, it might be overcrowded and hard to see them clearly. 

Our followup: We will try to dynamically increase the line's transparency when there are too many connected lines, or set a maximum limitation to the number of flight routes shown on the map.
